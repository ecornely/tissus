# Tissus

This is a really small project that I created for my wife to help her organise the tiles of a patchwork she's making.

It allows to generate randomly grid based on the amount of tiles available in each color and then in PyQt allow to exchange some tile's positions to fine tune the general aspect.

# TODOs
* Allow to have different sizes of tile
* Allow to choose the amount of tiles (x and y)
* Implement a MVC model
* Allow to configure in a window the tiles images, names, amount available aso.
